## Lesson 10: Increase DAO tokens liquidity 

> Difficulty: medium.

### Lesson Description 

The primary goal of any organization is to create new value. This value must be liquid on external markets. The more deals your DAO makes (i.e. the internal market is active) - the greater the valuation of your token. 

**To increase your token liquidity:**

- Add the `Token emission builder` contract address to the DAO core.
- Invest in the creation of more internal market value.
- Create new tokens using the `Token emission builder` and add their addresses to the DAO core to make them tradable on the market.
- Increase the agents' activity. Create more market agents that will be able to buy tokens in exchange for goods that they produce.
- Attract more agents to your DAO.
