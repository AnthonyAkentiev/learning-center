## Working with Ethereum testnet through the console

> Run this lesson only in testnet.

### Lesson Description

In order to complete this lesson you need to install the Ethereum console client. We recommend or [parity](https://ethcore.io/parity.html).

Then you need to syncronize it with the **testnet kovan** and get a bit of **ether**. The ether will be then used to send a transaction. You can do that in several ways:

- **Kovan Faucet** You can get test ether for free by going to [faucet]((https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet)). The easiest way is to get ether via Github Gist Faucet.
- **Make some friends!** Connect to our official Telegram channel: [Airalab Community](https://t.me/joinchat/A6wE1EOowDh7r1JQo51mvA), write your testnet address and ask for some free ether. Someone will help you for sure!

### Skill test

When you got some ether you can begin lessons.
