## Final DAO model.

If you have completed all the steps correctly, the final DAO model will include these contracts:

- `DAO core`
- `Shareholder token`
- `Ether funds`
- `DAO credit`
- `DAO market`
- `Market regulator`
- `Board of Directors`

**This does not include the `Crowdsale` and the `ShareSale` contracts because they were used onlye occasionally**
